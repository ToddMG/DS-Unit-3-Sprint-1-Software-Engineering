### What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate when others do the same for your code?

- In my opinion syntax and formatting are already covered in PEP8 and personal preference. I need my reviewer to be critical of the logic behind my code.
If there's a better way to do what I'm doing I'd like to know, and why my reviewer's logic makes more sense than mine.
If I'm reviewing someone else's code, I make sure to pay attention to the logic behind their programming, leaving syntax second and formatting last.9

### We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us improve this situation?
If we were to think of each computer as a virtual machine, then containers would allow us to set very specific foundations for each machine to work within its intended purpose.
Thanks to containers/dockers, the machine would come with every package and module it needs to function properly, thus allowing the user to dive in without any setup.
